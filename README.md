# pyutils
A collection of the various Python utilities and functions I use in my code.

To use this, download the "wolfinaboxutils" folder (or clone this repo), and import it as `from wolfinaboxutils.all import *` in your code. Or, you can import invididual sections with `from wolfinaboxutils import module_name`.

To see a demonstration of all the available functions, clone this repo and run test.py.
I will be updating this as I come across more functions I use frequently.
