# pyutils
A collection of the various Python utilities and functions I use in my code.

To use this, download the "wolfinaboxutils" folder (or clone this repo), and import any module or individual function from it as usual. (EG: `from wolfinaboxutils.searches import flatten`, `from wolfinaboxutils import searches`, `from wolfinaboxutils.searches import *`)

To see a demonstration of all the available functions, clone this repo and run test.py.
I will be updating this as I come across more functions I use frequently.
